Emoji Prediction
This project provides an emoji prediction system that maps a given text input to an appropriate emoji. The system is capable of predicting emojis for over 100 different emotions, objects, and actions, making it a versatile tool for text-to-emoji conversion.

How It Works:
Input: The user provides a text string (e.g., "I'm feeling so happy").
Processing: The system converts the input to lowercase and checks if any keyword (such as "happy", "love", "sad") matches the input.
Output: The system returns the corresponding emoji based on the identified keyword. For example, the input "happy" will return ðŸ˜Š.
Example:
Input: "I am so excited!"
Output: ðŸŽ‰
Supported Emojis:
The system currently supports 100+ different emojis related to:

Emotions: Happy, sad, angry, love, etc.
Animals: Dog, cat, monkey, etc.
Food and Drinks: Pizza, cake, burger, coffee, etc.
Transport: Car, bike, plane, etc.
Objects and Tools: Book, pencil, phone, etc.
